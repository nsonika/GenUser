# GenUser
## Inspiration  ✨

The idea for GenUser came from recognizing the common challenge of generating realistic user data for different projects. As developers and designers ourselves, we often found ourselves in need of user information that closely resembled real-world profiles. We realized the time-consuming nature of creating such data manually, which inspired us to develop GenUser as a solution.

## What it does 🚀

It is a user generation tool that simplifies the process of creating random user profiles. With just a few clicks, you can generate realistic user data that includes names, email addresses, usernames. But that's not all. GenUser also provides a convenient way to copy the generated user information with ease. Whether you're working on testing, prototyping, or any other project that requires user data, GenUser streamlines the process, saving you time and effort.

## How we built it 🔧

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project incorporates the RandomUser [API](https://randomuser.me/) to fetch realistic user data, including names, email addresses, and profile pictures.
